      <p>Here at EmpowerHer we strive to bridge the gap in women's opportunities in the workforce. Seeing the everyday struggles women experience led us to want to create an organization that will give girls the ability to be led by inspirational and credible mentors to lead them towards a path of success.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We offer mentorship in many fields to provide as much assistance as possible</p>
      <br>
      <p>Each mentor must go through an application review period and training to ensure credibility and safety of our mentees</p>
